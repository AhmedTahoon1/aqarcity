# Development Workflow & Collaboration Standards

## Our Standard Development Process

### 1. Planning & Analysis (Phase 1)
- **Requirement Analysis**: Understand the feature/issue completely
- **Technical Assessment**: Evaluate current system and identify impact areas
- **Architecture Review**: Check how changes fit with existing structure

### 2. Planning & Analysis (Phase 2) 
- **Database Impact**: Analyze schema changes, migrations needed
- **API Design**: Plan endpoint changes, data flow, security implications
- **Frontend Impact**: Identify UI/UX changes, component updates needed

### 3. Planning & Analysis (Phase 3)
- **Implementation Strategy**: Break down into minimal, focused steps
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Testing Strategy**: Plan comprehensive testing approach

### 4. Coding (Creating | Improving)
- **Database First**: Schema updates, migrations, seed data
- **API Development**: Backend endpoints, business logic, validation
- **Frontend Implementation**: UI components, state management, integration
- **Minimal Code Principle**: Write only essential code that directly solves the problem

### 5. Testing (DB, API, Frontend, Security)
- **Database Testing**: Verify schema, data integrity, performance
- **API Testing**: Endpoint functionality, error handling, edge cases
- **Frontend Testing**: UI functionality, user experience, responsiveness
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation

### 6. Documentation
- **Technical Documentation**: Code changes, API updates, database modifications
- **User Documentation**: Feature usage, configuration changes
- **Summary Reports**: What was implemented, how to use, testing results
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Update project knowledge base

## Key Principles
- **Minimal Implementation**: Only write code that directly addresses the requirement
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every change must be thoroughly tested
- **Clear Documentation**: Every implementation must be properly documented
- **Iterative Approach**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
- **Quality Focus**: Prioritize correctness and security over speed

## Collaboration Guidelines
- **Ask Before Planning**: Always ask user what they want before starting planning or when clarification is needed
- **No Test Execution**: User runs both server & client, so no need to execute tests during development
- **Feature Suggestions**: Regularly suggest important developments, new features, and useful improvements (اقترح تطويرات تراها مهمة وميزات جديدة ومفيدة)

## Feature Suggestion Framework
- **User Experience Improvements**: Identify UX/UI enhancements based on current functionality
- **Performance Optimizations**: Suggest database, API, or frontend performance improvements
- **New Feature Ideas**: Propose valuable features that align with AqarCity's real estate platform goals
- **Security Enhancements**: Recommend security improvements and best practices
- **Integration Opportunities**: Suggest useful third-party integrations or API enhancements

## Workflow Enforcement
This workflow must be followed for ALL development tasks, regardless of size or complexity. Each phase builds upon the previous one to ensure robust, maintainable, and well-documented solutions.
